# Keylimed


This is an educational project, please do not use this for illegal purposes or on anything other than your own devices.

This is a simple keylogger I created for my cybersecurity knowledge in C#. It tracks keystrokes,saves the keys to a file named keylimed.txt, and is emailed to the attacker. I added the functionality to enter an email to recieve the logged keystrokes to.
